# R Programming Class Activity

## Assigned; Friday 6 September 2024

## Due Friday; 6 September 2024, __by end of class__

---

## Learning Objectives

- Assigning and using variables in R
- Performing mathematical operations with variables
- Concatenating strings in R
- Creating simple plots in R

## Warm Up: Introducing R

If you have not already done so, please Start by installing R and RStudio on your computer. Spend a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the interface. You can copy and paste your code into RStudio and run it there.

If you would rather not use R and RStudio for this activity, then you could easily use the R programming online workspace available in the course resources at [https://www.oliverbonhamcarter.com/resources/dataanalytics_resources/](https://www.oliverbonhamcarter.com/resources/dataanalytics_resources/).

## Instructions

You will be editing the File, `writing/activity.md` to complete your work. In the activity file, there will be blocks of code which have been placed inside triple quotation marks. The code blocks look like the following.

``` R
# This line is a comment and will not be run by R.
# The below assignment is R code.
x <- 1 
```

Please copy and paste the code from the code blocks into R to run it. You are to note the output to respond to the questions under the code block in the activity file.Please ask if you have questions.__Note: Please be sure to remove the ToDo's of each question when it is completed.__

## Project Assessment

This is a check mark grade.

## GatorGrade Checking

You can also use `gatorgrade` to check the baseline requirements of this assignment by running the following command in your terminal:

`gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml`

If `gatorgrade` shows that all checks pass, you will know that you have met baseline requirements of this project.

After you have pushed your work to your repository, please visit the repository at the GitHub website (you may have to log-in using your browser) to verify that your files were correctly sent.

### Installing GatorGrade

- First, [install `pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/)
- Then, install `gatorgrade` with `pipx install gatorgrade`
You might also want to install VsCode to help you edit code as text files.
- Install `VSCode` or another editor that will come in handy when working with code in text files. See [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) for details on installing this editor.

## Seeking Assistance

Students who have questions about this project outside of the lab time are invited to ask them in the course's Discord channel or during instructor's or TL's office hours.
